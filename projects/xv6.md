# Exploration of xv6 x86 code for operating systems class

## The what

For my operating systems class I explored the [x86 version of the xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) operating system's codebase a bit.

For this class we implemented a few syscalls and implemented a scheduler.

## What was learned

It was interesting to understand the guts of how schedulers and syscalls work on the kernel side of the operating system.
