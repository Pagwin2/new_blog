# Comments Backend

## The what

I worked on making a HTTP service which returned HTML snippets which allowed for comments which I intended to add to my blog but didn't due to email being annoying and deciding that comments didn't add much.

If I remember correctly this was intended to use HTMX to minimize the need for page reloads without needing a bunch of javascript.

## What was learned

At the time besides realizing that I should've had the service use an SMTP connection instead of some specific API and with hindsight that I should've used sqlite rather than PostgreSQL for that project.
