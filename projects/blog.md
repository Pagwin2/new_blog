## The what

This blog is a place where I write thoughts mostly but not always about software.
The static site generator, Pagwin's Site Builder (PSB), and frontend code were done by me.

The static site builder doesn't do anything too crazy right now, however I intend to rewrite it to handle markdown and restructured text(RsT) itself. With that new power I'll then have it handle syntax highlighting, footnote/aside creation and table of contents creation.

Meanwhile the frontend code was done to try and maximize semantic HTML and aesthetics while also being a reasonable print.
I have some Open Graph tags so links to it in social media look okay and I have an Atom feed so people who care to track updates have a way to do so though I plan to create an XSLT transformation for that Atom feed so people who click the RSS icon aren't confused.

Also one last thing is that I use close to no Javascript, at present it's for easy syntax highlighting and in future I expect I'll use it for positioning footnotes/asides to the right vertically aligned with the thing referencing them.

## What was learned

Quite a bit about HTML and CSS.

## Visual/demo

You're looking at it.
