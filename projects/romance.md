# Romance (HackBU 2023 project) 

## The what

Romance was a CI/CD pipeline which I made for the 2023 HackBU hackathon.
If I remember correctly it was a git hook which read a config file to figure out which docker container(s) to run.
I also had time to build a not great looking web ui for it.

## What was learned

This is one of the earlier instances of me working on something with a very tight deadline where I found that constraint made me worke more effieciently than I normally do.
This takeaway is something which I don't think I've fully internalized yet but it is something I will occasionally stumble into under the right circumstances.
