## The what

Binghamton better bus in both of it's iterations is a web app to find a route from point to point in Binghamton using both the Broome county bus system as well as the OCCT bus system.
The HackBU iteration made use of the live maps available (at the time) to acquire the needed information about the bus systems.

In the 24 hour hackathon I was able to get a setup where I could input a start and endpoint and get a route which could be a layover at Binghamton University, the downtown bus terminal or in theory no layover with a single bus.
The one and only heuristic used was walking distance.

## What was learned

I learned some of the intricacies of the polyline algorithm and how the two bus live map APIs worked.
