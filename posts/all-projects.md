I'm writing this so I have one place where I've described all of my projects, in future I may make this a section of the site rather than just a post but for now this will do.
Note for future me, the markdown sucks because you wanted to have semantic HTML here and didn't know how to get markdown to generate `<article>` or `<section>` elements, you'll find the proper markdown under the `/projects` directory.

<h2 id="the-what">The what</h2>
<p>Binghamton better bus in both of itâ€™s iterations is a web app to find
a route from point to point in Binghamton using both the Broome county
bus system as well as the OCCT bus system. The HackBU iteration made use
of the live maps available (at the time) to acquire the needed
information about the bus systems.</p>
<p>In the 24 hour hackathon I was able to get a setup where I could
input a start and endpoint and get a route which could be a layover at
Binghamton University, the downtown bus terminal or in theory no layover
with a single bus. The one and only heuristic used was walking
distance.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-learned">What was learned</h2>
<p>I learned some of the intricacies of the polyline algorithm and how
the two bus live map APIs worked.</p>
