## Tell me about yourself

I've been interested in programming since later middle school to early high school when I went to a summer camp where we made games and I got deeply into the programming aspect.
After that point I got into learning about programming making a few projects over the course of highschool, taking both AP computer science courses and generally learning as much about programming as possible.
So when it came time to pick a major for college it was pretty apparent to me that I should pick something programming related and so I picked computer science at Binghamton university.
During my time there I worked on some more projects, both school work and stufff on my own time until I graduated bringing us to today.

## Why did you apply here?

Well, my aunt works at a company involved in the medical industry which led to me bring reccomended to look into medical device companies.
When I came across Boston Scientific I noticed that they had a notable emphasis on working with people just starting their careers and thought it would be worth applying.

## What have you heard about us?

I know that you are one of the largest medical device companies in the United states, making a varierty of medical devices for things like cardiovascular treatment and cancer among others.

## Have you ever worked on a team before?

Yes, for example in my senior year I took a class where I worked with a partner over the course of a semester to make a project where you could put in a start and end point on google maps to get a route using buses to get between those 2 points using both the county's bus system and the school's bus system, comared to outright google maps which only makes use of the county's bus system.

### Any problems?

A couple.
First for this project the partner I chose to work with ended up having issues with coming to class and not being especially responsive over messaging so I needed to start setting up weekly meetings to make sure we remained on track.
Secondly there was some disagreement over how to have the component I was making and the component the partner was making should communicate requiring some discussion and compromise.

## What would you describe as a negative of yourself?

I tend to be overly cautious about various things, using hedging words a lot among other things.

## Positive?

I'm good under pressure.
For example in my senior year of college an apartment in the building I was living in caught fire partway through the day while I was at university requiring me to make my way back to my apartment to grab some of my stuff and find a hotel to stay the night at.
