I'm writing this so I have one place where I've described all of my projects, in future I may make this a section of the site rather than just a post but for now this will do.
Note for future me, the markdown sucks because you wanted to have semantic HTML here and didn't know how to get markdown to generate `<article>` or `<section>` elements, you'll find the proper markdown under the `/projects` directory.
